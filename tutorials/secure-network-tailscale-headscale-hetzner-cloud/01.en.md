## Introduction

Tailscale is a modern VPN solution based on the WireGuard protocol, enabling simple and secure connections between 
devices. This tutorial will guide you through setting up Tailscale on Hetzner Cloud to create a secure, private network.

**Considerations**

There are two ways to setup your Tailscale network:
- **(Option 1)** Use the standard Tailscale servers (Simple setup but external service required)
- **(Option 2)** Host your own control server using Headscale (Advanced setup & maintenance but everything under your control)

**Prerequisites**

- At least one Hetzner Cloud server (CX22 or higher) or a dedicated server with public ip
- Basic Linux knowledge

## (Option 1) Setup Tailscale

For this option you only need an account on [https://tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com).

Now you can jump to [Install Tailscale Client](#install-tailscale-client)

## (Option 2) Install Headscale on Debian / Ubuntu

A list of the latest versions can be found here: [https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/releases/latest](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/releases/latest)

Download the Headscale package:
```bash
HEADSCALE_VERSION="" # E.g. "X.Y.Z" (NOTE: do not add the "v" prefix!)
HEADSCALE_ARCH="" # Your system architecture, e.g. "amd64" or "arm64"
wget --output-document=headscale.deb \
  "https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/releases/download/v${HEADSCALE_VERSION}/headscale_${HEADSCALE_VERSION}_linux_${HEADSCALE_ARCH}.deb"
```

Install the package:
```bash
sudo apt install ./headscale.deb
```

Make sure Headscale will start after a reboot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable headscale
```

Update the Headscale config to allow external connections:
```bash
HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_URL="" # Insert the public ip of your headscale server
sed -i "s/server_url: http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8080/server_url: http:\/\/${HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_URL}:8080/" /etc/headscale/config.yaml
```
```bash
sed -i 's/listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:8080/listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:8080/' /etc/headscale/config.yaml
```

Start Headscale:
```bash
sudo systemctl start headscale
```

Create your first user (replace "myusername" with your username):
```bash
headscale users create myusername
```

## Install & Connect Tailscale Client

On all devices which you want to add to your network you have to install the Tailscale client. For example your 
PC/Smartphone and a cloud server.

To install the client on your Linux server, use the following command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```
Now connect to the control server:

**(Option 1) With standard tailscale server**

> Requires a Tailscale account (Free plan available)

```bash
tailscale up
```

This command will give you a link to sign in and connect with the tailscale control server.

**(Option 2) With Headscale**

On the client:
```bash
HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_URL="" # Insert the public ip of your headscale server
tailscale up --login-server http://${HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_IP_OR_URL}:8080
```
This command will return a authentication url which you need to open in your browser. There you will find a command to 
execute on the headscale machine to autheticate. Make sure to replace "USERNAME" with your actual user.

**Other devices**

For your personal devices you should find the Tailscale app in the major app stores.

Additional download info can be found here: [https://tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)

> Keep in mind to add the IP/URL of your Headscale server if you used Headscale in the previous steps.

> You can find the private IPs of all clients in the Tailscale webinterface or using the command 
> "headscale nodes list" on your Headscale server.

## Security

After you connected all servers to your Tailscale/Headscale network, you should update the firewall of your 
cloud/dedicated servers. One approach would be to block all incoming traffic (except for your Headscale server)
and only allow needed traffic (like a website hosted on the server). Your server will get an internal ip from the 
Tailscale/Headscale network wich you can use on any connected client to securely access services on your 
server (e.g. SSH or a private website/service).
